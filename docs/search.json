With completing the test prep there was at least a 5% increase in the average score, going all the way up to a 10% increase.\nGender Differences: We can see that the students who ideintifies as women had a higher average score in the math section. However, in the reading and writing exams the men outshone women. It is interesting to notice that the women had heavy outliers in all exams whereas we don’t really see that trend with the men.\nLunch Type: We can see that students who had a standard lunch tended to score higher than those who were on either a free or a standard lunch.\nParental Education: We can see that students with parents who have completed a Master’s degree had the highest scores in all exams. The general trend with this is that the more education a student’s parent has gone through, the higher they tend to score on exams.\n\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard\nIf you would like to play around with the data and see how different variables interact with the average of the scores you can use this dashboard.\nExplore the Dashboard"

    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard designed for educators, parents, and individuals working closely with children. The dashboard’s goal is to compile data insights and display them in an eye-catching, intuitive manner that makes comprehension and decision-making easier. It is a useful tool for tracking patterns, assessing results, and determining workablse tactics related to the education, growth, or general well-being of children.\nThe dashboard’s main goal is to close the gap between useful applications and complicated data. It will use dynamic visualisations, filters, and summaries to deliver concise, useful insights. Without needing to be highly skilled in data analysis, users will be able to examine important indicators, spot trends, and come to well-informed conclusions. Furthermore, depending on the data displayed, the dashboard can have customised alerts or recommendations to point users in the direction of best practices.\nTeachers, parents, and professionals who interact with children in different capacities—such as social workers, counsellors, or program coordinators—are the dashboard’s target audience. Although this audience may not have much experience with advanced data analysis, they are probably experts in their particular industries. For example, teachers may be aware of patterns in student performance but lack the knowledge necessary to evaluate unprocessed data or decipher statistical results. In a similar vein, parents could appreciate clear-cut findings that are immediately linked to practical results.\nThe audience is anticipated to have little to intermediate knowledge of quantitative and data analysis. Even though they might comprehend fundamental ideas like averages, percentages, and trends, they are probably not comfortable with sophisticated statistical methods or programming languages. Because of this, the dashboard’s design places a high value on clarity and accessibility, making it possible for users to obtain insights without the need for specific technical knowledge.\nThe dashboard will have user-friendly navigation and informative elements to cater to the audience’s diverse levels of knowledge. For instance, to help explain complicated concepts, visualisations will be accompanied by tooltips, interactive instructions, and plain-language descriptions. The tool’s usefulness will be improved by filters and drill-down features that let users examine data pertinent to their particular situation. Furthermore, responsiveness and accessibility will be prioritised in the design to guarantee that users can interact with the dashboard on a variety of devices and settings.\nThe project’s overarching goal is to provide its audience with data-driven insights that can guide both their long-term and daily decisions. This could require teachers to pinpoint the areas in which their students want more assistance. For parents, it could entail monitoring developmental milestones or comprehending more general patterns that impact kids. In the end, our dashboard facilitates informed, significant decision-making by acting as a link between the abundance of data available and the real-world requirements of individuals who look after and instruct children."

With completing the test prep there was at least a 5% increase in the average score, going all the way up to a 10% increase.\nGender Differences: We can see that the students who ideintifies as women had a higher average score in the math section. However, in the reading and writing exams the men outshone women. It is interesting to notice that the women had heavy outliers in all exams whereas we don’t really see that trend with the men.\nLunch Type: We can see that students who had a standard lunch tended to score higher than those who were on either a free or a standard lunch.\nParental Education: We can see that students with parents who have completed a Master’s degree had the highest scores in all exams. The general trend with this is that the more education a student’s parent has gone through, the higher they tend to score on exams.\n\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard\nIf you would like to play around with the data and see how different variables interact with the average of the scores you can use this dashboard.\nExplore the Dashboard"

    "text": "Conclusion\nHere are the key findings of the study:\n\nGender: Male students scored significantly higher in math (+4.99) but scored lower in reading (-7.07) and writing (-9.10). Gender differences in writing were particularly pronounced.\nRace/Ethnicity: Students in Group E consistently outperformed other groups across all three subjects, with significant positive effects in math (+10.13), reading (+5.51), and writing (+5.14).\nParental Education: Students with parents holding only high school diplomas or less consistently scored lower across all subjects. For example, “high school” was associated with a -4.90 effect on reading scores and -5.81 on writing scores. Master’s degrees showed positive impacts, particularly on writing scores (+5.18).\nLunch Type: Students with standard lunches performed significantly better in all subjects: math (+10.88), reading (+7.25), and writing (+8.20), underscoring the role of nutrition in academic success.\nTest Preparation Course: Completing the test preparation course was strongly associated with improved scores. Students who did not complete the course scored lower by -5.49 in math, -7.36 in reading, and -10.06 in writing. Writing scores showed the largest impact of test preparation.\n\nFuture analysis could explore interactions between these variables, such as how the effect of test preparation varies across different racial or socioeconomic groups, or the impact of combining multiple interventions like better nutritional programs and targeted test preparation. Longitudinal studies could also assess the sustainability of these improvements over time.\nOverall, this dashboard offers actionable insights to guide decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of educational disparities. It highlights key factors contributing to student success, providing educators and policymakers with data-driven strategies to enhance academic outcomes across diverse student populations."
